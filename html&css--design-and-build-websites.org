** chapter 1 structure
   Every document has a structure. Structure makes a document more readable. In html files, elements are used to add structure. In this chapter, ~h1~ (main heading), ~h2~ (sub heading), ~p~ are introduced.

   Tag attribute, head and title element. Create a html page using notepad.

   Simple and short.
** chapter 2 text
   Two type of elements:
   1. structure element. Such as ~h1~, ~p~.
   2. semantic element. Such as ~em~, ~sup~, ~cite~.

   Elements introduced in this chapter:
   | element    | description                           | example                   |

   |------------+---------------------------------------+---------------------------|
   Note: some are semantic element, some are structure element.
   
   About white spaces in html documents: two or more spaces are treated as one. This is called *white space collasping*.

   On semantic elements: the purpose is to describe the content more accurately. Should not be used only for changing apprance.

*** comments
    1. I use semantic element very little.
    2. why semantic element should be used?
    3. html5 add many structure elements such as section, artical, nav.
** chapter 3 list
   Three types of list:
   - ordered list :: use numbers
   - unordered list :: use bullet
   - definition list :: used to define terminology
     
   And list can be nested.
   Examples:
   #+begin_src html
   <ol>
     <li>list item 1</li>
     <li>list item 2</li>
   </ol>
   
   <ul>
     <li>A nested list
       <ol>
         <li>aaaaa</li>
         <li>bbbbb</li>
       </ol>
     </li>
   </ul>
   
   <dl>
     <dt>Definition term</dt>
     <dd>definiton descript</dd>
     <dt>aaa1</dt>
     <dt>aaa2</dt>
     <dd>Definiton for aaa1 and aaa2</dd>
   </dl>
   #+end_src

** chapter 4 link
   #+begin_src html
   <a href="URL">Link </a>
   #+end_src

   User can click any content between <a> and </a> to go to the link.
   
   Value of href property can be:
   | type         | syntax        | description                                   |
   |--------------+---------------+-----------------------------------------------|
   | absolute url | www.baidu.com |                                               |
   | relative url | index.html    |                                               |
   | position     | #top          | top is the id value of an element in the page |
   | email        | mailto:a@b.c  | open mail client and send that mail           |
   Note: Position can be used together with urls.

   Open url in a new window: use the target property, and set value to "_blank". Should avoid use this, but if it is really needed, a good practice is inform the user first before open in new window.

** chapter 5 image
   #+begin_src html
   <img src="images/logo.png" alt="CA Company" title="CA is a company form USA" />
   #+end_src

   - size :: the specified size same as real size.
   - format :: jpeg for photograph(which has lots of color), png or gif for logo or illustrations(which has many part of flat color).
   - resolution :: browser display picture in 72 ppi. I don't know meaning of resolution.
     
   Other property
   - width and height.
   - align. left and right for horizontal align, top, middle, bottom for vertical align. *This property is deleted in html5*. Align left has the same effect as float left(align right as float right).

   New element introduced by html5:
   - figure. Associates an img element with a caption
   - figcaption. figure caption.
   - example
     #+begin_src html
     <figure>
       <img src="Food.jpeg" alt="Food" />
       <figcaption>All kinds of food</figcaption>
     </figure>
     #+end_src
     Notes: more than one img elements are allowed if there share same caption.
   
   Vector image: draw dots in grid and fill line and color dynamiclly, so that when scaled, the quality will not lose.

   Animate gif: a gif made of several frames, each of which display a different image.

   image thranpanrency. if the Transpenry part is straight, use gif, else use PNG. And if partically transpenry, also use PNG.
