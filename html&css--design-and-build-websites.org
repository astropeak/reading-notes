** chapter 1 structure
   Every document has a structure. Structure makes a document more readable. In html files, elements are used to add structure. In this chapter, ~h1~ (main heading), ~h2~ (sub heading), ~p~ are introduced.

   Tag attribute, head and title element. Create a html page using notepad.

   Simple and short.
** chapter 2 text
   Two type of elements:
   1. structure element. Such as ~h1~, ~p~.
   2. semantic element. Such as ~em~, ~sup~, ~cite~.

   Elements introduced in this chapter:

   Note: some are semantic element, some are structure element.
   
   About white spaces in html documents: two or more spaces are treated as one. This is called *white space collasping*.

   On semantic elements: the purpose is to describe the content more accurately. Should not be used only for changing apprance.

*** comments
    1. I use semantic element very little.
    2. why semantic element should be used?
    3. html5 add many structure elements such as section, artical, nav.
** chapter 3 list
   Three types of list:
   - ordered list :: use numbers
   - unordered list :: use bullet
   - definition list :: used to define terminology
     
   And list can be nested.
   Examples:
   #+begin_src html
   <ol>
     <li>list item 1</li>
     <li>list item 2</li>
   </ol>
   
   <ul>
     <li>A nested list
       <ol>
         <li>aaaaa</li>
         <li>bbbbb</li>
       </ol>
     </li>
   </ul>
   
   <dl>
     <dt>Definition term</dt>
     <dd>definiton descript</dd>
     <dt>aaa1</dt>
     <dt>aaa2</dt>
     <dd>Definiton for aaa1 and aaa2</dd>
   </dl>
   #+end_src
