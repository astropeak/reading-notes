** chapter 1 structure
   Every document has a structure. Structure makes a document more readable. In html files, elements are used to add structure. In this chapter, ~h1~ (main heading), ~h2~ (sub heading), ~p~ are introduced.

   Tag attribute, head and title element. Create a html page using notepad.

   Simple and short.
** chapter 2 text
   Two type of elements:
   1. structure element. Such as ~h1~, ~p~.
   2. semantic element. Such as ~em~, ~sup~, ~cite~.

   Elements introduced in this chapter:
   | element    | description                           | example                   |
   |------------+---------------------------------------+---------------------------|

   |------------+---------------------------------------+---------------------------|
   Note: some are semantic element, some are structure element.
   
   About white spaces in html documents: two or more spaces are treated as one. This is called *white space collasping*.

   On semantic elements: the purpose is to describe the content more accurately. Should not be used only for changing apprance.

*** comments
    1. I use semantic element very little.
    2. why semantic element should be used?
    3. html5 add many structure elements such as section, artical, nav.
** chapter 3 list
   Three types of list:
   - ordered list :: use numbers
   - unordered list :: use bullet
   - definition list :: used to define terminology
     
   And list can be nested.
   Examples:
   #+begin_src html
   <ol>
     <li>list item 1</li>
     <li>list item 2</li>
   </ol>
   
   <ul>
     <li>A nested list
       <ol>
         <li>aaaaa</li>
         <li>bbbbb</li>
       </ol>
     </li>
   </ul>
   
   <dl>
     <dt>Definition term</dt>
     <dd>definiton descript</dd>
     <dt>aaa1</dt>
     <dt>aaa2</dt>
     <dd>Definiton for aaa1 and aaa2</dd>
   </dl>
   #+end_src

** chapter 4 link
   #+begin_src html
   <a href="URL">Link </a>
   #+end_src

   User can click any content between <a> and </a> to go to the link.
   
   Value of href property can be:
   | type         | syntax        | description                                   |
   |--------------+---------------+-----------------------------------------------|
   | absolute url | www.baidu.com |                                               |
   | relative url | index.html    |                                               |
   | position     | #top          | top is the id value of an element in the page |
   | email        | mailto:a@b.c  | open mail client and send that mail           |
   Note: Position can be used together with urls.

   Open url in a new window: use the target property, and set value to "_blank". Should avoid use this, but if it is really needed, a good practice is inform the user first before open in new window.

** chapter 5 image
   #+begin_src html
   <img src="images/logo.png" alt="CA Company" title="CA is a company form USA" />
   #+end_src

   - size :: the specified size same as real size.
   - format :: jpeg for photograph(which has lots of color), png or gif for logo or illustrations(which has many part of flat color).
   - resolution :: browser display picture in 72 ppi. I don't know meaning of resolution.
     
   Other property
   - width and height.
   - align. left and right for horizontal align, top, middle, bottom for vertical align. *This property is deleted in html5*. Align left has the same effect as float left(align right as float right).

   New element introduced by html5:
   - figure. Associates an img element with a caption
   - figcaption. figure caption.
   - example
     #+begin_src html
     <figure>
       <img src="Food.jpeg" alt="Food" />
       <figcaption>All kinds of food</figcaption>
     </figure>
     #+end_src
     Notes: more than one img elements are allowed if there share same caption.
   
   Vector image: draw dots in grid and fill line and color dynamiclly, so that when scaled, the quality will not lose.

   Animate gif: a gif made of several frames, each of which display a different image.

   image thranpanrency. if the Transpenry part is straight, use gif, else use PNG. And if partically transpenry, also use PNG.
     
   On resolution:
   From book 2, when image displayed in screen, resolution has no meaning, only pinexes make sence. I think resolution only related to displaying devices, not image itself.
** chapter 6 table
   - element
     | name  | description                                | example |

** chapter 7 form
   - points
     - difference between ~button~ element and ~input submit~ or ~input image~. ~button~ allow more flexiable apperance of a summit button, because the apperance is done by the html codes insides the element. While ~input submit~ or ~input image~ are all empty element, so the apperance is fixed.
     - difference between radio button and selection list. They have same function. Use radio button when the selection number is small(so that user can see all at a glance), otherwise use selection list.

     - legend not need a <br>

** chapter 8 extra markup
   - toc
     - indicate html version
       - representation elements in html4 are deleted, such as 
         - center: center a text
         - strike: put a line through a text
         - font: set font
         They can all be achieved by CSS.

       | &times; | X              |
       | &divide | divide sign    |
** chapter 9 flash, video and audio
   - An code example that plays flash file
     #+begin_src html :tangle flash_test.html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <head>
       <script type="text/javascript" src="./html&css--design-and-build-websites/swfobject.js"> </script>
       <script type="text/javascript">
         swfobject.embedSWF("./html&css--design-and-build-websites/Car-speakers-590x90.swf", "car", "590", "90", "8.0.0");
       </script>
     </head>
     <body>
       <div id="car"><p>Your browser doesn't support flash.</p></div>
     </body>
     #+end_src
     Notes:
     - swfobject's github officail page says flash is dead, the project was not maintained any more and the developers moved to other project. So no need to try it anymore I think.
     - At first I wrote "test/javascript" mistakenly, so the code not works.
   - reasons for why flash will dead
     - In 2005, many js library(such jquery, prototype) created that supporting making simple animation
     - In 2007, apple's iphone doesn't support flash
     - In 2008, html5 support playing video or audio using video or audio element
     - flash can't be used by disabled.
*** TODO practice this latter

** chapter 10 introducing CSS
   - browser quirks or CSS bug
     - Some browser may display an element unexpected.
     - Cross browser testing is a good way to find this type of problems. If an element displays abnormal in one browser while OK in all other browsers, then it must the bug of that browser. Cross browser testing tools:
       - browsercam.com
       - browserlab.adobe.com
       - browsershots.org
       - CrossBrowserTesting.com
     - two websites on this topic
       - PositionIsEverything.net. Lots of artical on this website.
       - QuirksMode.org :: This website list if css property, selectors are supported by many browser(different version). Quite comprehensive. Over 16 years old. And also has a js section(the author claimed it is the largest section) that describe practical js knowledge. Such as object detection ~http://quirksmode.org/js/support.html~
   - css inheritance
     - use ~inherit~ as property's value to inherit it from parent element
     - Some property will inherit value from parent, some will not.
   - cascade rule
     - last rule. last rule will overide former one.
     - specificity. More specific a selector, the higher priority.
     - IMPORTANT. ~!important~ decorator will make the rule the highest priority.

** chapter 11 color
   - color terminology
     #+begin_src css
     red #ff0000
     green #00FF00 rgb(0,255,0)
     blue #0000FF
     #+end_src
     Why green is different?

   - contrast
     - Too high or too low contrast will all make the text hard to read
     - for reversed out text, larger line height and big font weight make it easier to read.
     - contrast check tool: https://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html#fg=000000,bg=AEAEAE. The page will calculate two value, which should pass the threshhold.
   - select single element by assigning "class" such as "one", "two".
   - HSL color
     - hue: a color in color circle. 0-360. 0 is red, 120 is green, 240 is blue.
     - saturation: ammount of grey. 0%-100%. the larger, the bright-coloured.
     - lightness: the ammount of white or black. 0-100. 0% is black, 100% is white, 50% is normal.
     - examples
       #+begin_src css
       hsl(0,100,100) = rgb(255,0,0)
       #+end_src
   - opacity
     - rgba
     - hsla
     - for browser that not support a, use rgb as fallback to rgba.
       #+begin_src css
       p {
           color: rgb(255,0,0);
           color: rgba(255,0,0,0.5);
       }
       #+end_src
** chapter 12 text
   - typeface
     - Five typefaces and some font names of that type
       - serif. Georgia, Times, Times New Roman. 
       - sans-serif. Arial, Verdana, Helvetica.
       - monospace. Courier, Courier New.
       - cursive. Comic Sans MS, Monotype Corsiva.
       - fantacy. Impact, Haettenschweiler.
     - browsers are supposed to supported at least one font of all five typefaces.
     - At most 3 font type in one page.
   - font-family peroperty is used to set typeface, its value is a font stack(a list of font seperated by comma). If first font is not installed in the browser, then the second will be tried. Examples:
     #+begin_src css
     body {
         font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", Serif;
     }
     #+end_src
     Notes:
     - If there are spaces in font type name, then font name should be encolsed in "".
     - Put a generic font type such as 'Serif', 'Sans-Serif' in case all ahead font are not installed.
   - other property of a font except type
     - weight. [Light, Medium, Bold, Black]. Specify the stroke width.
     - style. [Normal, Italic, Oblique]. Oblique is put Normal on an angle.
     - stretch. [Condensed, Regular, Extended]. The width of character.
   - TOBE continued. THis chapter is quite new to me.
