* Learning web design
** misc
   Read through the TOC. Seems no many new contents.
   Five sections: get started, html for structure, css for presentation, web graphics, from start to end.

   New points: optimize graphics for different types.

   Seems no more info after reading three chapters: table, form, css techniques. So there is no need to read this book in detailed manner.
