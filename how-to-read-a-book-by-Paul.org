* How to read a book by Paul form university Michigan
  - three times. Overview and structure are far more important than details, for 1. you can only memorize very little details, 2. know big picutre, you know where to find details when needed.
  - focus on high information part(as time is limited), at each round. Hourglass model. Information density. Spend more time on high density part. Spend time on low density just a waste of time.
  - mark up text, but not too much. the first round's markup helps the second round
  - generate questions actively. When you have a question, you are more concentrated.
  - take notes at finally step.
  - multiple small intevers instead of a long inteval. One hour is good.

  This method should be practiced for quite long time before you can do it well.

  Pitfull of my reading method:
  - focus on details unnecissarly.
